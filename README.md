# speak-to-the-natives

This project aims to provide simple examples of how to do things with Elm's Natives. Elm's natives are [undocumented on purpose](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/DPuUPv72abc) and subject to change. While Elm is currently a solid way of creating web projects, there is still limited functionality that is best aided by reaching out into JS and either interecting with the DOM or performing some strange JS function that currently has no wrapper in Elm.

[Ports](http://elm-lang.org/guide/interop#ports) are already a way of interecting with JS. However, it is limited compared the functionality possible through using Natives.
